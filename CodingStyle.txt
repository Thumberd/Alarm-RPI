#Formatting
79 Character Line Length
4 Space Indents
There should always be a single space around operators (==, +, and, or, etc.), except for keyword arguments.
Always leave a space after commas as well, unless it's the last character of a line (see No Trailing WhiteSpace below).
Keep a space between # and the text of comments, and two spaces between code and # for inline comments.

#Names

For consistency use the following naming conventions:

    CONSTANT_NAME = 1

    def function_name(variable_name):

    class ClassName(object):

    attribute_name = 0
